        <p>
          All of the content here is arranged using CSS Flexbox. I spent a total
          of 13 hours in various
          <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com">Team Treehouse</a>, and assorted
          other resources to get this far. The three hours with Professor
          Jimenenez on flexbox styling really got me interested and sent me down
          a (fun) learning rabbit hole that still hasn't reached bottom!
        </p>
        <p>
          The rules and settings within Flexbox are really fun and easy to work
          with. In the past I built smaller webpages using floats and grids and
          so on; what a headache that was!
        </p>
        <p>
          This website landing page took me about 3 hours to build, all thanks
          to the power of Flexbox and a few powerful @media rules.
        </p>
        <p>This page is optimized for mobile screens first.</p>

        <h2>Site Highlights</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Flexbox: </strong>The Flexbox Layout (Flexible Box) module
          provids a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space
          among items in a container, even when their size is unknown and/or
          dynamic (thus the word “flex”).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>CSS Media Queries: </strong>The @media rule, introduced in
          CSS2, makes it possible to define different style rules for different
          media types, such as styling for mobile and desktop at the same time.
